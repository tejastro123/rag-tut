Lesson 6.2: Contextual Retrieval (Anthropic's Technique)
FreeCodeCamp Production RAG Course (April 2026)

Problem: When you chunk documents, chunks lose their context.
"The company was founded in 1994" - Which company? What document is this from?

Solution: Use an LLM to prepend context to each chunk BEFORE embedding.
Result: 67% fewer retrieval failures (Anthropic research).

This technique was introduced by Anthropic in late 2024 and has become
a standard practice for production RAG systems.
